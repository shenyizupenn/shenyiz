    <p>Hi, do you wanna see my pixel farming?</p>

        The project "Ecological Coexistence: Permaflow Gardens" embodies a
        visionary integration of architecture, agriculture, and nature, inspired
        by the intricate symbiosis observed in treehouses and Pixel Farming.
        This initiative targets both local farmers and tourists in Ojai, aiming
        to offer them a novel farming experience grounded in organic practices,
        ecological mindfulness, and experiential living. The project's ethos is
        to transcend mere cohabitation of species, creating a vibrant,
        productive ecosystem that fosters a deep connection between humans and
        nature.
        <br />
        At the heart of this endeavor is a commitment to organic farming and the
        study of local plant species and innovative farming techniques like
        pixel farming. Through onsite visits and extensive research, the project
        seeks to develop a farming system that harmonizes with the local
        environment, benefiting both the ecosystem and the community.
        <br />
        The design process begins with an exploration of geometric patterns,
        embracing circles, curves, and tangent lines to discover new forms and
        spatial arrangements. This foundational work emphasizes scale,
        direction, and movement, aiming to create dynamic, engaging spaces that
        inspire and intrigue. By pushing the boundaries of form and color, the
        project explores the interplay of positive and negative space, seeking
        to create a visually and experientially rich environment.
        <br />
        As the project evolves, these initial patterns and shapes are
        reorganized and layered to define various zones within the farm,
        including static, dynamic, and flexible areas. This rule-based system of
        design leads to the creation of a diversified architectural landscape
        that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, drawing color
        inspiration from artists like Sam Gilliam and Laura Owens to enrich the
        visual experience.
        <br />
        The planning strategy includes careful consideration of circulation
        paths for farmers and visitors, featuring elevated walkways and diverse
        modes of travel to enhance the experience and minimize disruption. This
        approach fosters an intima
