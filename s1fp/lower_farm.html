    <p class="paragraph3">The Flexible Area is dedicated to fostering community engagement and
        personal reflection, emphasizing the project's holistic approach to
        design and its focus on the human-nature bond. The adoption of a
        "designing in layers" strategy for the farm's layout maximizes diversity
        and productivity by categorizing plant species according to their
        environmental needs, facilitating a balanced ecosystem.
        <br />
        Crop rotation practices further exemplify the project's ecological
        mindfulness, with seasonal rotations like field peas and sweet potatoes
        enhancing soil health and crop yield. This thoughtful approach to
        agriculture not only supports ecological balance but also promotes a
        sustainable, productive farming system that enriches the local community
        and environment, embodying the project's vision of ecological
        coexistence and permaflow gardens.</p>
